    raise OSError(f"""\
Could not locate the machine on any available COM port.

Troubleshooting steps:
1. Ensure the device is properly connected via USB/Serial cable.
2. Verify that the correct drivers are installed for your operating system.
3. Double-check that the expected COM port is visible in your systemâ€™s device manager.
4. If using `port_name`, confirm it matches exactly (e.g., 'COM3' on Windows). call with scan_COMports(port_name = "COM2")
5. If using hardware ID or manufacturer name, confirm those constants are correct in the "variables.py" file.
6. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the device, then rerun this program.

HARDWARE_ID = {HARDWARE_ID}
